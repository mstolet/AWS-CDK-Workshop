# Olist Data Analysis and Visualization

# Description
This project was developed in a uni programming subject at Universidade de Brasilia in 2020. The goal was to create a dashboard using a public data base from a e-commerce website. The group chose one from Olist on Kaggle and plot some graphical visualizations before putting them in a dashboard. The most challenging aspect of the project was that it was required from us that we did not use pandas to plot, and had to use "for loopings" for that. Also, besides all the interactivity that Plotly already has, we added dropdowns so the user could refine his research even more.
